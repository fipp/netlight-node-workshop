# Netlight Node Workshop

## 1. Create a Slack-bot

### A. Create a new empty project

1. Go to https://github.com. Create a Github account if you don't already have one, and log in. Then go to https://github.com/new.

2. You should see an interface where you can name your project, manage if it should be public or private, and if some files should be added automatically.

3. You have now set up an empty git project.

> *Git is a version control system that lets you save snapshots of your code, so that you can make changes without having to worry about losing your work, or breaking the program without knowing how you broke it.*

> *These snapshots are referred to as commits.*

> *Online services, like Github, are often used so that you can save your work in the cloud, and cooperate with other developers on a project.*

### B. Download the project to your computer

1. Open your terminal
